1# 🎞️ CSS Transition Timing Functions

## 🧠 Explanation
This program demonstrates how different **CSS transition timing functions** affect the speed of an animation when an element moves.  
When you hover over each image, it moves horizontally (`translateX`) using various timing styles.  

Each easing type changes how the motion feels — whether it moves at a constant speed, starts slowly, or ends smoothly.

## ⚙️ Types of Transition Timing Functions

| Type | Property | Description |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Linear** | `linear` | Moves at a **constant speed** throughout the animation. |
| **Ease** | `ease` | Default transition; starts slow, speeds up, and slows again. |
| **Ease-In** | `ease-in` | Begins **slowly**, then accelerates. |
| **Ease-Out** | `ease-out` | Starts **fast**, then slows down at the end. |
| **Ease-In-Out** | `ease-in-out` | Combines both — **slow start** and **slow end**. |
| **Steps(5, start)** | `steps(5, start)` | Moves in **five discrete steps**, creating a choppy, frame-like effect. |
