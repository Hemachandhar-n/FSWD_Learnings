## ðŸ§  Learning Notes

- **Static:** Default behavior; element stays in the natural page flow.  
- **Relative:** Moves the element without affecting others.  
- **Absolute:** Takes element out of normal flow; positioned using top/right/bottom/left.  
- **Fixed:** Stays visible even when scrolling; positioned relative to the viewport.  
- **Sticky:** Combines relative and fixed depending on scroll position.
